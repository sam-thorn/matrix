This is a fun movie aggregator app with a decidedly Matrix theme. Please select the blue or the red pill from Morpheus to enter.

This was created as a Friday Project during my time at Enspiral Dev Academy.
Our nominated project team name was 'The Matrix' :wink:

To run the project please do the following:
- clone the project
- cd matrix
- npm i
- npm run dev
- navigate to localhost:3000 in a new browser tab and hit refresh
